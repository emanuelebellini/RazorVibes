# Razor Vibes - ASP.NET MVC (Classic) CRUD Example

This sample shows how to build a basic ASP.NET MVC (classic .NET Framework) CRUD application that uses an **in-memory data store**. It's designed to open in Visual Studio (e.g., VS2026) and run without a database server.

## What you get
- **ProductsController** with full CRUD actions.
- **InMemoryProductStore** for storage (static list).
- **Razor views** for list/create/edit/details/delete.

## Running in Visual Studio
1. Open `RazorVibes.sln`.
2. Restore references (if prompted).
3. Press **F5** to run.

## Notes
- The store is **in-memory** and resets on every app restart.
- This uses .NET Framework 4.8 and ASP.NET MVC 5 style conventions.
